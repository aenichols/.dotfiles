## Neovim -
> where colors are like a box of crayons and every file is a blank canvas just waiting to be filled with your brilliance.

With the ColorMyPencils function, you can color your world in any shade you desire, with "gruvbox-baby" being the default (because let's be real, who doesn't love a good baby gruvbox?).

But that's not all, I've also included a variety of language servers to ensure your code is error-free and your autocomplete is on point. Plus, with the help of cmp and lsp, navigating your code is a breeze.

But wait, there's more! I've also included lualine as your statusline, with a gruvbox-baby theme for that added touch of class. And for all you file explorers out there, telescope and fzf have got you covered for easy file navigation.

So what are you waiting for? Start coloring your world and let your creativity run wild with Neovim.
